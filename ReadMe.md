# Diffusion Simulation using FTCS and BTCS and Convergence Analysis

This project is a Python script for solving diffusion problems and analyzing its convergence properties and error norms.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

## Step
- Clone those repository to your local machine.
- Put file diffusionSchemes.py in the same folder with file dif_1.py, dif_2.py, dif_4.py, dif_5.py
- Execute the code in file dif_1.py using Python 3.x to create the result for Question 1
- Execute the code in file dif_2.py using Python 3.x to create the result for Question 2
- Execute the code in file dif_4.py using Python 3.x to create the result for Question 4
- Execute the code in file dif_5.py using Python 3.x to create the result for Question 5

## Results:
- The code file dif_1.py will produce output and visualizations of 1Stable.png and 1Stable_nt_Vary.png
- The code file dif_2.py will produce output and visualizations of 2Unstable.png, 2Unstable_Diff.png, and 2BTCS_DiffStep.png
- The code file dif_4.py will produce output and visualizations of 4AnalyticSolution_DifferentBoundary.png and 4AnalyticSolution_SteadyState.png
- The code file dif_5.py will produce output and visualizations of 5Error_Norm(L2).png and 5Order_Convergence.png
